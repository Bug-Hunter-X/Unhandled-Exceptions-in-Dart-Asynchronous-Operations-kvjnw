# Unhandled Exceptions in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dart asynchronous programming: inadequate exception handling in `Future` operations.  The original code lacks robust error handling, potentially leading to unexpected application crashes or silent failures.  The improved solution provides a more resilient approach.

## Bug
The provided `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from an API. It currently includes basic error handling, but lacks the robustness to prevent unexpected application crashes, or provide meaningful feedback to the user.

## Solution
The solution offers more robust error handling:
- More specific exception handling and logging, allowing for better debugging and user feedback.
- Using a `try-catch` block to handle potential network errors and JSON decoding errors separately.
- Providing meaningful error messages and gracefully handling issues without crashing the application.
